# PhysicsSimulations

A collection of standalone physics simulation experiments, each in its own folder.

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [VerletChain](VerletChain/) | 2D particle chain driven by Verlet integration with mouse interaction |

## VerletChain

A rope/chain simulation where particles are connected by distance constraints and move under gravity. Click and drag any particle to interact with the chain in real time.

Built with C++20, OpenGL 4.6, and GLFW.
